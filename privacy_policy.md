**Last Updated:** [July 11, 2025]

Thank you for using Cross Connect ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information about you when you use our mobile application (the "Service").

### 1. Information We Collect

We collect information you provide directly to us and information that is generated automatically when you use the Service.

**A. Information You Provide to Us:**

*   **Account Information:** When you create an account, we collect your email address, password, display name, age, gender, country, and an optional bio.
*   **Profile Picture:** We collect the profile picture you choose to upload.
*   **User Content:** We collect the content you create, including text and photos you post to the feed, and the messages and images you send in private chats.

**B. Information We Collect Automatically:**

*   We do not collect personal information automatically, but we use Firebase services which may collect usage data for analytics and crash reporting purposes as described in their own privacy policies.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

*   Provide, maintain, and improve the Service.
*   Create and manage your user account.
*   Allow you to communicate with other users.
*   Display your profile and content to other users as part of the app's functionality.
*   Personalize your experience.

### 3. How We Share Your Information

Your public profile information (display name, photo, bio, age, country) and the posts you create are visible to other users of the Service.

We do not share your private information, such as your email address or private chat messages, with third parties, except as necessary to provide the Service through our backend provider, Google Firebase.

We use the following Google Firebase services, which may process your data according to their own privacy policies:
*   **Firebase Authentication:** For user login and account management.
*   **Cloud Firestore:** To store your profile data, posts, chat messages, and other app data.
*   **Firebase Storage:** To store user-uploaded images (profile pictures, post images, chat images).

### 4. Data Storage and Security

Your data is stored on Google Firebase servers. We rely on the security measures provided by Google to protect your information. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

### 5. Your Choices

You can review and update your profile information at any time through the app's settings. You can also delete your posts and, ultimately, delete your account, which will remove your data from our active databases.
